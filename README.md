# EURO-VO tutorials 

This repository is dedicated to the update of the scientific tutorials of the EURO-VO webpage (http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials). Ideally we can use this repository to exchange and collaboratively work on drafts of the tutorial updates. Once we are happy with the result, it is published on the EURO-VO webpage and the ASTERICS DADI Product Repository. 

If you are interested in learing about the Virtual Observatory or going through some of the tutorials, please go to http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials and have a look at the tutorials there. The tutorials in this repository are  still under development.
